### List of tasks for server side

Fork full node and add endpoint to unityAPI feature that will receive information on user's progress. It should receive user's STRAX address which will act as identifier of the user, highest coins score, highest distance ran and it will return info on reward issued (no reward or txId). 

User gets CRS20 token rewards after getting 20\50\150\500 coins or after setting highest score of 20 / 40 / 70 / 100 / 200m.

Also user gets NFT once he runs the game for the first time. 



You need to deploy new SRC20 token and new NFT. Server's wallet should own all supply of SRC20 token and should be able to issue new NFTs. 



Deploy this modified node on the server that Iain will provide and open port for unity API.
